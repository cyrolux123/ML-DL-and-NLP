The FIFA World Cup is an international football tournament where teams from around the world compete for the prestigious title. Organized by national football associations under the guidance of an international committee, the tournament is held every four years. Before reaching the main event, teams must first go through a qualification round to secure their spot.

One of the significant aspects of the tournament is its global appeal. It brings people together to support their teams, creating an atmosphere of excitement, unity, and shared experiences. This event also offers a platform for exploring cultural ideas such as identity, globalization, and nationalism.

Each FIFA World Cup is hosted by a different nation, which is responsible for organizing and managing the event. The host country automatically qualifies and has the honor of playing the first match. Hosting the World Cup brings significant social and economic benefits, motivating many nations to bid for the opportunity.

The tournament's history dates back to 1930, when Uruguay hosted the first edition. Over the years, it has grown into one of the most-watched sporting events globally. In 1998, the World Cup expanded to include 32 teams, up from 24 in 1994, making it a more inclusive event. This expansion also saw changes in the tournament format, with the introduction of 8 groups of 4 teams instead of 4 groups of 6.

To ensure fairness in the tournament, new methods have been introduced to resolve drawn matches, ensuring a clear winner is decided. These developments highlight the efforts to maintain the competitive integrity of the tournament as the "Greatest Show on Earth," enjoyed by millions around the world.
